Project flow:
	1. Pseudo Code
	2. Figure out how to use Google API Map Data
	3. Algorithm Definition
	4. Real time data

Goals:
1. Connecting sufficiently to the Google Maps API
2. We are able to sufficiently code a genetic algorithm bot (complete with well defined encoding,
   reproduction, crossover and mutation)
3. Our bot will actually get a delivery driver to an actual destination (optimized or not)
4. Defining acceptable fitness (which will allow us to efficiently stop the GA from continuing
   to calculate optimal routes)
5. Given a fixed set of locations to deliver to, our bot is able to optimize paths to a fixed
   set of delivery locations.
6. The delivery locations are constantly (in real time) changing  



Pseudo Code for Genetic Algorithm Project
	-Define a bot that accesses Real map data and calculates the best/quickest route
	-Encoding
	-Reproduction
	-Crossover
	-Mutation

 
Makeing intersection class to define where intersections of roads start and stop. 
As in the borders of our array or which roads you are allowed to get on from which other roads.
The numbers are a 0, 1, 2(0 standing for no road there, 1 for intersection to both roads, 2 for not allowed to contiune onto road/blockage in the way or road ends)	


Assumptions: 
-one ways do not exist in our map
